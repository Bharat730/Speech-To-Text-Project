Whisper Output:  Linnell's pictures are a sort of Up Guards and Adam paintings, and Mason's exquisite idles are as national as a jingo poem. Mr. Birkett Foster's landscapes smile at one much in the same way that Mr. Carcar used to flash his teeth, and Mr. John Collier gives his sitter a cheerful slap in the back before he says, like a shampooer in a Turkish bath, Next man!
