  English: Hello. Hello? Hello. Yes sir, greetings. Am I speaking with Kaptan Singh?

Speaker 2:
  Original: Ji.
  English: Yes.

Speaker 1:
  Original: Main Shriram Finance Company se baat kar rahi hun sir. Yahan se aapka loan chal raha hai.
  English: I'm speaking from Shriram Finance Company, sir. Your loan is running from here.

Speaker 2:
  Original: Ji ji ji. Namaskar madam.
  English: Yes, yes, yes. Greetings, madam.

Speaker 1:
  Original: Sir ji, haan ji jaankari dene ke liye call kiya tha sir. Kuch customer abhi hum logon ne select kiya hai jinka track record accha hai, kist vagairah bounce nahi hai. Toh agar aap loan badhana chahen toh badha sakte hain loan ko apna abhi.
  English: Sir, yes, I called to give you some information. We have selected some customers whose track record is good, whose installments etc. haven't bounced. So if you want to increase your loan, you can increase it now.

Speaker 2:
  Original: Accha. Kya sunaiye madam? Haan ji.
  English: Okay. What's up, madam? Yes.

Speaker 1:
  Original: Ji basically aapki jo kist ke baare, haan bata rahi hun sir. Basically abhi jo aapki kist bach rakhi hai na, unka byaas se nahi dena hoga aapko, woh toh maaf ho jayega aapka. Theek hai? Ek aapko doctor on call facility provide ki jayegi jismein aap doctor se salah le sakte hain audio call aur video call par. Saal mein paanch baar, do saal mein das baar. Aur abhi aapka loan sir chal raha hai ki close ho gaya?
  English: Yes, basically about your remaining installments, yes, I'm telling you sir. Basically, the remaining installments you have, you won't have to pay interest on them, that will be waived for you. Okay? You will be provided with a doctor on call facility where you can consult a doctor on audio and video calls. Five times a year, ten times in two years. And sir, is your loan currently running or has it been closed?

Speaker 2:
  Original: Mera madam yeh loan toh chala hi nahi. Isi main hain abhi.
  English: Madam, this loan hasn't even started. I'm still in it.

Speaker 1:
  Original: Achcha achcha. Okay okay. Okay koi baat nahi hai. Dekhiye agar abhi policy mein hoga matlab jaise ki hum unko de rahe hain na, mere jo jaise aap hain, aapka loan chal raha tha, kisi month close hua hai na. Toh unke liye offer hai sir. Toh abhi shayad aapko do percent ki chhut bhi mil jaye kyunki ab aapka close ho gaya hai na toh main repay deni hai. Lekin agar chal raha hota toh woh toh pakka aapko confirm do percent ki chhut mil jaati. Bataiye agar lena chahte hain badha kar toh main ek baar share kar deti hun detail branch pe. Woh contact kar lenge aapse.
  English: Oh, okay, okay. Okay, no problem. Look, if it's in the current policy, meaning like we are giving it to them, like you, your loan was running, and it closed in some month. So there's an offer for them, sir. So maybe you'll get a two percent discount because now since your loan has closed, you have to repay. But if it was running, you would have definitely gotten a confirmed two percent discount. Tell me if you want to take it by increasing it, then I will share the details with the branch once. They will contact you.

Speaker 2:
  Original: Baat yeh hai madam, main pitaji se ek baar puch ke bataunga. Main unka ladka hota hun. Pehle jo yeh maine karaya tha, yeh loan maine nahi karaya tha. Yeh jo loan hai yeh maine nahi karaya. Main in chizon se dur rehta hun. Farming karta hun. Main main mere paas jo loan hai main apne upar hi leta hun. Lekin main baat yeh hai ek baar pitaji se salah leni achchi hoti hai na. Ya toh aap koi apna personal number de dijiye main aapko bata dunga ya fir jaisa aapka woh ho.
  English: The thing is, madam, I'll ask my father and let you know. I am his son. Previously, the one I had done, I didn't take that loan. This loan, I didn't take it. I stay away from these things. I do farming.  The loan I have, I take it upon myself. But the thing is, it's good to consult with father once, right? Either you give me your personal number, I will let you know, or as you wish.


Speaker 1:
  Original: Main call karungi aapko Monday pe. Ek baar aap aaj baat kar lijiyega agar.
  English: I will call you on Monday.  Please talk to him today if you can.
