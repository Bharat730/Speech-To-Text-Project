Speaker 1: Hello? Hello.
Speaker 2: Oh, hello. I didn't know you were there.
Speaker 1: Neither did I.
Speaker 2: Okay. I thought, you know, I heard a beep. This is Diane in New Jersey, and.
Speaker 1: I'm Sheila in Texas, originally from Chicago.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm originally.
Speaker 1: From Chicago also.
Speaker 2: I'm in New Jersey now, though.
Speaker 1: Well, there isn't that much difference. At least, you know, they all call me a Yankee down here, so what can I say?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't hear that in New Jersey now.
